Thank you for purchasing RageSpline!

Best way to start with RageSpline, is to check out the bundled game: RageCar.

When creating your own RageSpline shapes, drag one of the bundled prefabs to your scene and use it as a starting point.

Important commands:

Double-click = Add new control point to selected RageSpline-object
Del = Delete selected control point
K/L = Change outline width at selected control point
N = Switch selected control point to natural/sharp.
